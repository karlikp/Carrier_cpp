 The feature executes the Dijkstra algorithm
*  
*  Good to know, that at the beginning of the program:
* 
*  - The city which was choosen the center is assigned the value zero.
*	 Whereas all other cities is assigned the distance variable equal to a maximal posible value;
*  - Every city includes a bool value equal to "false" in the structure variable called "visited",
*	 (The value "false" means that given city hasn't been visited by algorithm .\n\n
* 
* The algorithm executuion:\n
*
* 1) The closest unvisited city (from center) is serached and saved to a variable called "current";\n
* 2) The routes from center to all other cities are cheacked,
*	 If the distance are shorter than current saved way,
*    the distance is overwritten and city from variable "current" are assigned to structure variable "previaus";\n
* 3) Then city from the variable "current" is marked as visited, and value true is assigned to variable "visited" of structere given city;\n
* 4) The points from 1 to 3 are executed as many time as there are saved a cities in the container (unordered_map);\n
* 5) The unvisited cities are saved in the vector called "unavailable".
