# ðŸšš Courier  	

This project finds the shortest path between one city and the rest of the cities contained in the file.
I used Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the shortest path problem.

### ðŸ’¬ Context of the project:
This was my main project from the first semester of my studies.
I developed it as part of a computer programming course.

### ðŸš€ My motivation:
I chose this project because I was interested in how the Google Maps application can so efficiently find the optimal route between two points.

## ðŸ“Œ To run the program:
1. Clone the repository
2. Change your working directory to the `Source` by cd `Courier/Source`
3. Compile with g++ by `g++ *.cpp *.h -o courier.exe`
4. Run the executable:
- On Linux by `./courier.exe -i dataSet.txt -o output.txt -c Poznan`
- On Windows by `courier.exe -i dataSet.txt -o output.txt -c Poznan`
5. Open output.txt file to check the program output

Feel free to change the content of the dataset.txt file or change the central city instead of Poznan to test my program ^^

Remember about appropriate data order:<br>
[city1] [city2] [distance1]<br>
[city2] [city3] [distance2]<br>
etc.<br>
