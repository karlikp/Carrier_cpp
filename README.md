This project finds the shortest path between one city and the rest of the cities contained in the file.
I used Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the shortest path problem.

## :speech_balloon: Context my project:
This was my main project from the first semester of my studies.
I developed it as part of a computer programming course.

### :blue_heart: Motivation:
I chose this project because I was interested in how the Google Maps application can so efficiently find the optimal route between two points.
